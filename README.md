#### Hi there. As you can guess, this is my GitHub prophile

Ain't much to say right here in this space, but you can take a look at my repos. This is most of the work I do as a PhD candidate. If I write something, I'll post it here. 
I believe in transparency and open access to most of what researchers do, so I'll just share all here.

#### Contact
Until I've done with my PhD feel free contact me at: `leonardocefalobis@uniba.it`
