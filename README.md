## Hi.
#### As you can guess, this is my GitHub profile.

Ain't much to say right here in this space, but you can take a look at my repos. This is most of the work I do as a PhD candidate. If I write something, I'll post it here. 
I believe in transparency and open access to most of what researchers do, so I'll just share all here.

#### Research activity/interests
I'm a statistician, basically I'm into spatial Bayesian statistics, but given, you know, my position I'm 100% open to collaborations of any kind. Some repos that may be interesting:
  - [R package SchoolDataIT](https://github.com/lcef97/SchoolDataIT), you can also find it on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SchoolDataIT/index.html)
  - Ongoing work on the distribution of accesses to support centers for women victims of gender-based violence in the Apulia region (Italy), [here](https://github.com/lcef97/CAV_Puglia)
  - Ongoing draft of my PhD [thesis](https://github.com/lcef97/PhD_Thesis?tab=readme-ov-file)

#### Contact
Until I've done with my PhD feel free contact me at: `leonardocefalobis@uniba.it`. 
There should be the link to my linkedin profile somewhere if you're interested. 
Also here's [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZdUNpuAAAAAJ&hl=it)
